# Flavor Forensics

Have you ever wondered why raspberry flavor is blue? Or why the first Gatorade tasted so bad they had to ask if they could stop drinking it?

## The Blue Raspberry Mystery

Blue Raspberry is a flavor that defies nature. Real raspberries are red. Black raspberries are... well, dark purple-black. There is a *Rubus leucodermis* (Whitebark Raspberry) that has a bluish hue, but it's not neon blue.

### Why Blue?

The story often goes back to the 1970s and the banning of **Red Dye No. 2**.
<Callout type="info" title="Red Dye No. 2">
  In 1976, the FDA banned Red Dye No. 2 (Amaranth) due to potential health risks. This left candy and ice pop makers with a limited palette for their red flavors (cherry, strawberry, raspberry, watermelon).

To distinguish raspberry from the crowded "red" market (dominated by Cherry and Strawberry), companies like **Gold Medal** (who made syrups for sno-cones) and **ICEE** started using **Blue No. 1** (Brilliant Blue FCF).

*   **Visual Distinction:** It allowed customers to easily tell raspberry apart from cherry.
*   **The Tongue:** It stained tongues blue, which was a huge marketing plus for kids.

## Gatorade: The Sweat of the Gators

In 1965, a team of researchers at the **University of Florida** led by **Dr. Robert Cade** set out to answer a question: Why were football players wilting in the Florida heat?

The answer: They were losing fluids and electrolytes (salts) through sweat and burning through their carbohydrate stores.

### The First Batch

The team whipped up a concoction of water, sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate.
*   **The Taste:** It was reportedly disgusting. One player said it tasted like toilet bowl cleaner.
*   **The Fix:** Dr. Cade's wife suggested adding lemon juice.
*   **The Result:** Lemon-Lime Gatorade was born.

<Callout type="tip" title="Fun Fact">
  The Florida Gators credits the drink for their 1967 Orange Bowl victory. The opposing coach, when asked why they lost, famously said, "We didn't have Gatorade. That made the difference."

## Future Research

*   [ ] Investigate the "Mystery Flavor" of Dum Dums (often the tail end of one batch mixing with the start of another).
*   [ ] The origin of "Grape" flavor (methyl anthranilate) and why it tastes nothing like real grapes.
*   [ ] Banana flavor: Is it based on the extinct Gros Michel banana?

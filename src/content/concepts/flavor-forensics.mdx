# Flavor forensics

Initial research notes on flavors that don't make sense.

## Blue raspberry

*   **Core Question:** Why is it blue? Real raspberries are red/black.
*   **Hypothesis:** To distinguish from cherry/strawberry/watermelon?
*   **Key Event:** 1976 FDA ban of Red Dye No. 2 (Amaranth).
    *   *Need to verify timeline.* Did blue raspberry exist before 1976?
    *   Gold Medal (sno-cones) vs ICEE. Who was first?
    *   **Blue No. 1 (Brilliant Blue FCF):** The specific dye used.

<Callout type="info" title="Research Note">
  Check the impact of tongue staining on marketing to children. Was that a happy accident or the goal?

## Gatorade

*   **Origin:** University of Florida (Gators), 1965. Dr. Robert Cade.
*   **Problem:** Players losing electrolytes/fluids in heat.
*   **The "Flaw":** The original formula tasted terrible.
    *   *Quote to find:* "Tasted like toilet bowl cleaner"?
    *   Role of lemon juice in fixing the flavor.
*   **Legacy:** How did it become a "flavor" of its own?

## Other "Nonsense" Flavors to Investigate

*   **Grape:** Methyl anthranilate. Why does it taste like purple, not grapes? (Concord grape connection?)
*   **Banana:** The Gros Michel vs Cavendish theory. Is "fake banana" actually what bananas used to taste like?
*   **Mystery Flavors:** (e.g., Dum Dums). Is it just the transition between batches?

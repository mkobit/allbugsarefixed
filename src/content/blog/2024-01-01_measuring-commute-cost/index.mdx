# Outline: The high cost of commuting

This post explores the personal and economic toll of commuting, utilizing tracked data and cost analysis.

## 1. Thesis

- **Core Argument:** Commuting is a "soul suck," a waste of personal time, and a significant waste of economic resources.
- **Goal:** To quantify these costs using real-world data and extrapolation.

## 2. Data collection & methodology

- **Tracking:**
  - Rudimentary tracking of commute times and legs from home to work.
  - **Reality Check:** I used poor tools and didn't invest in better ones (e.g., Amp Flow, personal app).
  - **Method:** Primarily a stopwatch on my phone.
  - **Challenge:** Data is sometimes sampled, sometimes forgotten.
  - **Precision vs. Accuracy:** Discussion on the reliability of the dataset (highly accurate samples vs. consistent daily precision).
- **Privacy:**
  - Methodology for masking the exact starting location while still providing valuable insights into travel times and density.
  - Data presented as coarse-grained times for each leg.

## 3. Planned visualizations & data sources

- **Commute Maps:** Visualizing travel density and time variance.
- **Specific Legs:**
  - Visualizing each leg and commute method: Drive & Park vs. Drive Dropoff.
  - Comparisons: Bike vs. Walk vs. Bus vs. Train.
  - Note: We've already mostly self-optimized.
- **External Data:**
  - **Metra:** Looking at train data (if available).
  - **Chicago Maps:** Overlays of bike and bus maps to visualize downtown commute methods.
- **Divvy Bikes (Potential):**
  - Scraping Divvy data to correlate distances and duration.
  - Comparing personal tracked times against public bike-share data.

## 4. Cost & time analysis

- **Time Extrapolation:**
  - Calculating total time spent commuting per year.
  - "Time Back": How much free time could be reclaimed daily/monthly without this commute?
- **Economic Impact:**
  - Comparing direct costs (transit/fuel) vs. opportunity costs.
  - **Opportunity Costs:** Lost time, impact on health, family time, and more.

## 5. Feasibility of activities

Addressing common anecdotes (e.g., "Can't you just read or work on the train?").

- **Constraints:**
  - **Train:** Jerkiness, seating availability, embarking/disembarking time, actual time available for deep work.
  - **Biking:** Safety concerns (helmets, traffic awareness), inability to safely listen to audiobooks/podcasts while navigating city streets.
  - **Conclusion:** Most "productive" activities are non-feasible during these commutes.

# Outline: The High Cost of Commuting

This post explores the personal and economic toll of commuting, utilizing tracked data and cost analysis.

## 1. Thesis
*   **Core Argument:** Commuting is a "soul suck," a waste of personal time, and a significant waste of economic resources.
*   **Goal:** To quantify these costs using real-world data and extrapolation.

## 2. Data Collection & Methodology
*   **Tracking:**
    *   Rudimentary tracking of commute times and legs from home to work.
    *   **Challenge:** Data is sometimes sampled, sometimes forgotten.
    *   **Precision vs. Accuracy:** Discussion on the reliability of the dataset (highly accurate samples vs. consistent daily precision).
*   **Privacy:**
    *   methodology for masking the exact starting location while still providing valuable insights into travel times and density.
    *   Data presented as coarse-grained times for each leg.

## 3. Planned Visualizations & Data Sources
*   **Commute Maps:** Visualizing travel density and time variance.
*   **Divvy Bikes (Potential):**
    *   Scraping Divvy data to correlate distances and duration.
    *   Comparing personal tracked times against public bike-share data.

## 4. Cost & Time Analysis
*   **Time Extrapolation:**
    *   Calculating total time spent commuting per year.
    *   "Time Back": How much free time could be reclaimed daily/monthly without this commute?
*   **Economic Impact:**
    *   Comparing direct costs (transit/fuel) vs. opportunity costs (lost time).
    *   Cumulative impact over time.

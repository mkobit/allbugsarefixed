## Introduction & Usage
*   Introduction to Beancount as a plain-text accounting tool.

    *   Importing data from banks.
    *   Categorizing transactions.
    *   Monthly reconciliation process.

## Getting Insights

*   Examples of insights:
    *   Monthly burn rate.
    *   Category breakdown (Food, Rent, Tech).
    *   Net worth tracking over time.
*   Visualizing the data (charts/graphs).

## Research & Automation
*   Source code examples:
    *   Custom importers for specific banks.
    *   Scripts for generating reports.
*   Engineering aspects:
    *   Using Python for customization.

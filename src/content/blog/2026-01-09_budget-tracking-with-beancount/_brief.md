## Introduction and usage

    *   **Tool:** [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/) - A double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial transaction records in a text file, read them, and run reports.
    *   **Alternative:** [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.com/) - A local-first personal finance tool that uses SQLite.
    *   **Alternative:** "Raw SQLite with Metabase" - Using a simple SQLite database for transactions and connecting [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) for visualization.
    *   **Inspiration:** [Paisa](https://github.com/paisaos/paisa) - Another open-source ledger-based finance manager (uses ledger-cli/beancount under the hood but with a UI).

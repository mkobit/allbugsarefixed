# Budget Tracking with Beancount

<Callout type="info" title="Draft Status">
  This post is currently in the **Draft** phase. The content below is a placeholder for the upcoming article.
</Callout>

This post will cover my journey with **Beancount**, a double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial transaction records in a text file, read them, and run reports.

## Outline

I am currently outlining the following sections:

1.  **Introduction & Usage**: How I use Beancount for daily tracking.
2.  **Getting Insights**: Leveraging the data to understand financial health.
3.  **Research & Automation**: Source code for importers and reporting scripts.

> *See `_brief.md` in the source folder for the full outline.*

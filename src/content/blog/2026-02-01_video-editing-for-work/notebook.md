# Video editing for work

## Idea
A basic walkthrough of my experience getting started with video editing using DaVinci Resolve. I want to highlight the power of the tool while also pointing out confusion points for beginners.

## Notes
- **Context**:
  - Started basic video editing for personal use.
  - Used DaVinci Resolve.
  - Used it to make clips for highlighting feature releases.
  - Cannot share videos or links in the blog post.

- **What I've done**:
  - Keyframes.
  - Basic colorization/editing.
  - Used AI to help walkthrough processes.
  - Relied on YouTube videos for "dumbed down" explanations.

- **Themes**:
  - **Power & Coolness**: The tool is incredible.
  - **Confusion for Newbs**:
    - Many ways to do the same thing.
    - Project vs. Clip structure / database management.
    - The learning curve is steep.

- **Alternatives**:
  - Mention CleanShot Pro as a potential simpler alternative (haven't used it for this specifically but thinking about it).

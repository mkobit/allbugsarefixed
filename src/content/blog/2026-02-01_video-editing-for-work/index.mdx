# Video editing for work

I've begun very basic video editing using DaVinci Resolve for personal use. I've done keyframes, some colorization with editing, used AI to walk through it, and found YouTube videos which explain things simply.

I want to talk about the power and coolness of the tool, but want to point out what is confusing for a total newb like many ways to do one thing, project and clip structure, and more.

I've used it to make clips for highlighting features releases.

I think there is another tool to do this but I haven't used it (CleanShot Pro maybe?).

This is just going to be a basic blog walkthrough of what I've done so far and why video editing is interesting. I won't be able to share any video or links.

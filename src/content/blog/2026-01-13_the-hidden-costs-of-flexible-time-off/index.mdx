# Concept

Investigating the shift to Flexible Time Off (FTO) policies.

## Key areas
1. **Company perspective**: Lowered risk, removal of PTO liability from balance sheets.
2. **Employee perspective**: Loss of accrued payout, lack of boundaries/overwork prevention.
3. **Legal/accounting**: State laws on payout (e.g., California, Colorado) and how FTO circumvents them.

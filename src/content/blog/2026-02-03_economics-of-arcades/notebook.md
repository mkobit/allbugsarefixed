# Economics of Arcades

## Idea
Analyzing the cost of playing games in modern arcades, specifically focusing on the credit system, conversion rates, and the high cost per game.

## Raw Notes (from user)
- "I met a decade right now" -> likely "I am at an arcade right now"
- "credit system how they have parts wipes" -> likely "card swipes"
- "games are insanely expensive"
- "shooter game that is $2 and a half dollars per credit"
- "Lowest credit amount, it's $20 for antique price" -> likely "entry price"
- "most expensive, it's $120, they're $77" -> Unclear. Maybe $120 buys 770 credits? Or the cost is $77?
- "It is controverse scheme is 10.4 cups" -> likely "conversion scheme is 10.4 credits" (per dollar?)
- Goal: "shows me how expensive some of this is and I want to look it completely"

## Research/Questions
- Verify the "77" figure.
- Clarify "10.4 cups" -> Is it 10.4 credits per dollar?
- If $20 is the entry price, how many credits does that get you?
- If $2.50 is the cost per credit, that seems extremely high if the conversion is ~10 credits/dollar (which would make a credit $0.10).
    - Wait, if a game is "$2.50 per credit", usually that means "it costs X credits which equals $2.50".
    - Or does it mean "1 Credit = $2.50"?
    - If "conversion scheme is 10.4", maybe 10.4 credits per dollar?
    - If 10.4 credits = $1, then 1 credit = ~ $0.096.
    - If a game is "$2.50", that would be ~26 credits.
    - User said "shooter game that is $2 and a half dollars per credit". This phrasing is tricky. Maybe "2.5 credits"? Or "$2.50 value"?
- Need to investigate standard arcade pricing models (e.g., Dave & Busters, Round 1).

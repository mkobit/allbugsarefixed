# Economics of Arcades

## Idea
Analyzing the cost of playing games in modern arcades, specifically focusing on the credit system, conversion rates, and the high cost per game.

## Key observations
- I observed a modern arcade using a card swipe system instead of coins.
- Games appeared insanely expensive.
- A shooter game cost roughly $2.50 per play.
- Credit bundles had varying price points:
  - Entry level: $20.
  - High tier: $120.
- The conversion rate was around 10.4 credits per dollar (likely for the base tier, but better at higher tiers).

## Research questions
- **Pricing structure:** Analyze the pricing tiers.
  - If 10.4 credits = $1.00 (base rate), then 1 credit ≈ $0.096.
  - Need to calculate the "bonus" credits at higher tiers (e.g., the $120 tier) to see how the cost-per-credit drops.
- **Game cost:**
  - I noted a shooter game costing "$2.50".
  - At the base rate ($0.096/credit), a $2.50 game would cost ~26 credits.
  - **Hypothesis:** Modern arcade games often cost 10-20+ chips/credits.
  - A "premium" shooter could easily be 25-30 credits ($2.50-$3.00).
- **Credit packages:**
  - Entry: $20.
  - High Tier: $120.
  - Need to look up real-world pricing examples (e.g., Round 1, Dave & Buster's) to match these numbers.

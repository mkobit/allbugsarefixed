# Economics of Arcades

## Idea
Analyzing the cost of playing games in modern arcades, specifically focusing on the credit system, conversion rates, and the high cost per game.

## Key observations
- The user observed a modern arcade using a card swipe system instead of coins.
- Games appeared insanely expensive.
- A shooter game cost roughly $2.50 per play.
- Credit bundles had varying price points:
  - Entry level: $20.
  - High tier: $120.
- The conversion rate seemed to be around 10.4 credits per dollar.

## Research questions
- **Pricing structure:** Verify the "10.4 credits per dollar" conversion rate.
  - If 10.4 credits = $1.00, then 1 credit ≈ $0.096.
- **Game cost:**
  - The user mentioned a shooter game costing "$2.50".
  - If the game costs ~26 credits (at $0.096/credit), that equals ~$2.50.
  - If the user meant "2.5 credits", that would be ~$0.24 (very cheap, unlikely for "insanely expensive").
  - **Hypothesis:** Modern arcade games often cost 10-20+ chips/credits.
  - A "premium" shooter could easily be 25-30 credits ($2.50-$3.00).
- **Credit packages:**
  - Entry: $20.
  - High Tier: $120.
  - Need to look up real-world pricing examples (e.g., Round 1, Dave & Buster's) to match these numbers.

# Economics of Arcades

## Idea
Analyzing the cost of playing games in modern arcades, specifically focusing on the credit system, conversion rates, and the high cost per game.

## Refined Transcript
I am at an arcade right now and I'm looking at the credit system, how they have card swipes and the games are insanely expensive. There's a shooter game that is $2.50 per play (per credit?). You use cash to get credits, and the credits are used to play games.

For the lowest credit amount, it's a $20 entry price. For the most expensive tier, it's $120—[unclear: they're 77? maybe 770 credits?]. The conversion scheme is roughly 10.4 credits [per dollar?]. That just shows me how expensive some of this is and I want to look into it completely.

## Research Questions
- **Pricing Structure:** Verify the "10.4 credits per dollar" conversion rate.
    - If 10.4 credits = $1.00, then 1 credit ≈ $0.096.
- **Game Cost:**
    - The user mentioned a shooter game costing "$2.50".
    - If the game costs ~26 credits (at $0.096/credit), that equals ~$2.50.
    - If the user meant "2.5 credits", that would be ~$0.24 (very cheap, unlikely for "insanely expensive").
    - **Hypothesis:** Modern arcade games often cost 10-20+ chips/credits. A "premium" shooter could easily be 25-30 credits ($2.50-$3.00).
- **Credit Packages:**
    - Entry: $20. (How many credits? If 10.4/$, maybe ~208?)
    - High Tier: $120. (User said "they're 77" - maybe 770? But 770 credits for $120 is worse value than 10.4/$. Maybe 1xxx?)
    - Need to look up real-world pricing examples (e.g., Round 1, Dave & Buster's) to match these numbers.

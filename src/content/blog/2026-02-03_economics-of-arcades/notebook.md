# Economics of Arcades

## Idea
Analyzing the cost of playing games in modern arcades, specifically focusing on the credit system, conversion rates, and the high cost per game.

## Key observations
- I observed a modern arcade using a card swipe system instead of coins.
- Games appeared insanely expensive.
- A shooter game cost roughly $2.50 per play.
- A single swipe for the Contra game cost 10.4 credits.
- Credit bundles had varying price points:
  - Entry level: $20.
  - High tier: $120.

## Research questions
- **Pricing structure:** Determine the actual dollar value of a credit.
  - If a Contra game (10.4 credits) is comparable to the shooter game ($2.50), then 1 credit ≈ $0.24.
  - If 1 credit ≈ $0.24, then the $20 entry bundle might provide roughly 83 credits.
- **Bonus credits:**
  - Need to investigate how many "bonus" credits are included in the $120 high-tier bundle to lower the effective cost per game.
- **Comparison:**
  - Compare this implied cost (approx. $0.24/credit) with standard pricing at major chains like Dave & Buster's or Round 1.

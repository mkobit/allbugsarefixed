# Why are there so many ads for lawyers?

## Idea
Investigate the prevalence of attorney advertising. This is a mix of history and journalism. The goal is to humanize the reason rather than relying on speculation or AI-generated answers.

## Historical Context
*   **Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977)**: This Supreme Court case was the turning point. Before this, legal advertising was largely banned as "unprofessional."
    *   *Holding:* The First Amendment protects truthful attorney advertising as commercial speech.
    *   *Key Quote:* "The belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism."

## Field Research Plan
*   [ ] **Billboards:** Document locations, slogans, and phone numbers.
*   [ ] **Bus Ads:** Look for local firms vs. national referral networks.
*   [ ] **TV/Newspaper:** Note the tone (aggressive? helpful? scary?).
*   [ ] **Phone Numbers:** Call the numbers on the ads.
    *   Is it a robot?
    *   Is it a call center or a law office?
    *   Record the experience (journalistic approach).
*   [ ] **Email:** Reach out to contacts found in ads.

## Missing Data (To Research)
*   **Advertising Spend:** Find statistics on legal marketing spending (TV, digital, outdoor) for 2024/2025.
*   **Market Saturation:** Are there more lawyers now per capita than in 1977?

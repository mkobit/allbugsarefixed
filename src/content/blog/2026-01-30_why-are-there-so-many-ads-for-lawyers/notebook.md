# Why are there so many ads for lawyers?

## Idea

Investigate the prevalence of attorney advertising.

## Historical context

*   **Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977)**: This Supreme Court case was the turning point.
    Before this, legal advertising was largely banned as "unprofessional."
    *   *Holding:* The First Amendment protects truthful attorney advertising as commercial speech.
    *   *Key quote:* "The belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism."

## Field research plan

*   [ ] **Billboards:** Document locations, slogans, and phone numbers.
*   [ ] **Bus ads:** Look for local firms vs. national referral networks.
*   [ ] **TV/newspaper:** Note the tone (aggressive? helpful? scary?).
*   [ ] **Phone numbers:** Call the numbers on the ads.
    *   Is it a robot?
    *   Is it a call center or a law office?
    *   Record the experience (journalistic approach).

## Missing data (to research)

*   **Advertising spend:** Find statistics on legal marketing spending (TV, digital, outdoor) for 2024/2025.
*   **Market saturation:** Are there more lawyers now per capita than in 1977?

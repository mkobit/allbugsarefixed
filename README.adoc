= All Bugs Are Fixed Blog

A blog built with Astro.

== Development

=== Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v20 or later recommended)
*   npm
*   Docker (for Devcontainer)
*   VS Code + Dev Containers extension (recommended)

=== Getting Started

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd allbugsarefixed
    ```
2.  *Open in Dev Container (Recommended):*
    *   Open the project folder in VS Code.
    *   When prompted, click "Reopen in Container".
3.  *Install dependencies (if not using Dev Container):*
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  *Run the development server:*
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server, typically at http://localhost:4321.

=== Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the production site to the `dist/` directory.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
*   `npm run astro ...`: Runs Astro CLI commands directly.

== Deployment

The `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow handles building the site. Deployment needs to be configured separately based on the chosen hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages).

== Custom Domain (allbugsarefixed.com) & HTTPS

Setting up a custom domain and HTTPS involves these general steps (specifics depend on your hosting provider and domain registrar):

1.  *Domain Purchase:* Acquire the domain name `allbugsarefixed.com` from a domain registrar.
2.  *Hosting Provider DNS Configuration:*
    *   Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages).
    *   Follow their instructions to point your domain to their service. This usually involves adding DNS records (like `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME`) in your domain registrar's settings.
3.  *HTTPS/SSL Certificate:*
    *   Most modern hosting providers offer free, automated SSL certificates (often via Let's Encrypt). Ensure this option is enabled in your hosting provider's settings for your custom domain.
    *   If your provider doesn't offer this, you may need to obtain and configure a certificate manually, but this is less common for static site hosting.
4.  *Astro `site` Configuration:* Update `astro.config.mjs` with your site URL:
    ```javascript
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    // ... other imports

    export default defineConfig({
      site: 'https://allbugsarefixed.com', // Add this line
      // ... integrations etc.
    });
    ```

Refer to the documentation of your specific hosting provider and domain registrar for detailed instructions.

# Scratch Zone

This directory serves as a working scratch zone for project notes, project plans, implementation plans, and decision logs during development sessions.

Files in this directory are ignored by git (except this README) and are intended for temporary development planning and documentation.

## File Structure

Project files should follow this naming convention:
- `yyyy-MM-dd-proj-name.md` - Project tracking files with date and descriptive name

Example:
- `2025-01-04-blog-bootstrap.md` - Blog bootstrap project
- `2025-01-15-accessibility-audit.md` - Accessibility audit project

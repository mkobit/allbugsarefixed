# Blog Content Guidelines

All content within this directory must adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Sentence Case for Headers:** All headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) must use sentence case. Only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized.
    *   *Correct:* "Icons and styling"
    *   *Incorrect:* "Icons & Styling"
2.  **Sentence Per Line:** To facilitate easier diffs and reviewing, every sentence in the Markdown source must start on a new line. Do not wrap paragraphs as a single long line.
